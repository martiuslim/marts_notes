### Chapter 1: The Go-Getter `1`
- Joe was a go-getter. He worked hard, worked fast, and was headed for the top. Joe was ambitious and aimed for the top.
- Sometimes it felt as if the harder and faster he worked, the further away his goals appeared. It seemed like he was doing a lot of *going* but not a lot of *getting*.
- 

### Chapter 2: The Secret `9`
- Be genuine, always.
- The more successful people are, the more willing they are to share their secrets with others.
- Pindar wanted to "share her coffee with the world" (referring to Rachel's "famous" coffee) while Joe wanted to "make a killing" through reproducing the coffee on an industrial scale.
  - Illustrates two different directions with regards to wealth creation.
- There is nothing wrong with making money or lots of it. It's just not a goal that will make you successful.
- Pindar's **Trade Secret** was just one word: *Giving*.
- Most people just laugh when they hear that the secret to success is *giving*. Then again, most people are **nowhere as successful as they wish they were**.
- The majority of people operate with a mindset that says to the fireplace, "First give me some heat, *then* I'll throw on some logs".
- "*You can't always get what you want, but you get what you expect.*"
  - What you focus on is what you get.
- The One Condition of getting to know the Five Laws: *Actually trying it out.* 
  - Not by thinking about it, not by talking about it, but by applying it in your life.

### Chapter 3: The Law of Value `21`
- Pindar *radiates* success. 
  - "It's not just money, it's something far more powerful than money."
- It struck Joe that Pindar was exceedingly gracious to everyone they encountered.
  - "It never hurts to be kind to people."
- Ernesto started off running a hot dog cart. After a few years his cart was written up as the "*Best outdoor dining experience in the city*". He was the head chef and owner of Iafrate's Italian-American CafÃ© as well as half a dozen other restaurants and several hundred million dollars worth of commercial real estate.
  - "*Appearances can be deceiving. Truth is, they nearly always are.*"
- Pindar had emphasized the word "experience" for a reason. Ernesto had made buying a hot dog into an unforgettable event.
  - Ernesto was good at remembering the details of his customers: birthdays, favourite colours, other interests, etc.
  - "*Everyone likes to be appreciated.*"


> The **Golden Rule of Business**: *All things being equal, people will do business with and refer business to those people they know, like and trust.*

- What distinguishes a good restaurant from a great restaurant? It's not only about better food.
  - A bad restaurant tries to give *just enough* food and service, both in quanty and quality, to justify the money it takes from the customer.
  - A good restaurant strives to give the *most* quantity and quality for the money it takes.
  - "But a *great* restaurant - ahh, a *great* restaurant strives to defy imagination! Its goal is to provide *a higher quality of food and service than any amount of money could possible pay for*."

> **The Law of Value**: *Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.*

- "Does it make money?" is not a bad question. It's just a bad *first* question. 
  - It starts you off pointed in the wrong direction.
- "The *first* question should be 'Does it serve? Does it add value to others?' If the answer to that question is yes, *then* you can go ahead and ask, 'Does it make money?'".
- "The point isn't to have others pay you more, it's to *give* them more. You give, give, give."
  - "Why? Because you love to. It's not a strategy, it's a way of life".
- "All the great fortunes in the world have been created by men and women who had a greater passion for what they were *giving* - their product, service or idea - than for what they were *getting*. And many of those great fortunes have been squandered by others who had a greater passion for what they were *getting* than what they were *giving*."

### Chapter 4: The Condition `35`
- Joe had to meet his third-quarter quota and needed to land the BK account before Friday. 
- Jim Galloway called with the bad news that Joe's company was not getting the contract renewal for a multinational firm Jim represented. 
- Joe was going to hang up, then decided to give Jim a referral for a competitor Ed Barnes who he thought could be a good fit for the firm's contract that Jim just lost. 
  - "No, you don't owe me, Jim. I just hope it works out. Sorry we couldn't help this time."

### Chapter 5: The Law of Compensation `39`
- Following the First Law, or giving more in value than what you take in payment does not necessarily mean that the *payment* you receive will increase.
  - "The First Law determines how *valiable* you are. In other words, your *potential* success, how much you *could* earn. But it's the Second Law that determines how muc you actually *do* earn."
- "Through LSC (Learning Systems for Children, Inc.), we expect to touch the lives of twenty to twenty-five *million* kids. And that in a nutshell is the Second Law."

> **The Law of Compensation**: *Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.*

- "*Your compensation is directly proportional to how many lives you touch.*"
- Joe always thought it seemed so unfair that how movie stars and top athletes pulled down those huge salaries. Or how CEOs and corporate founders could marshal such gigantic earnings. But people who were doing such great and nobel work - like school teachers - never got paid what they're worth. 
  - It's not just a question of their *value* but also a question of *impact*.
- "You get to determine your level of compensation - it's under your control."
  - "If you want more success, find a way to serve more people. It's that simple."
- "There are *no limitations* on what you can earn, because you can *always* find more people to serve".
  - The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. once said "Everybody can be great because anybody can serve".
  - Another way to say this would be "Everybody can be successful because anybody can *give*."
- Nicole was brought up with a belief system that there are two types of people in the world. There are people who *get rich*, and there are people who *do good*. Her belief system said that you're either one or the other, you cannot be both. 
  - As her business was growing, she saw how hard her partners were working and how many kids' lives they were changing. As a result, she saw that her old belief system was only getting in the way and not *serving*. So she decided to change it. Just like that.
- "Have you ever made up a story? Your life works the same way. You just make it up. *Being broke and being rich are both decisions.* You make them up, right up here (referring to your mind). Everything else is just how it plays out."
  - *What you focus on is what you get.* 

### Chapter 6: Serving Coffee `53`
- Rachel gave Joe a freshly ground pound of her famous coffee as he dropped Pindar off back home. 
- To practise the Second Law, Joe served a cup of Rachel's famous coffee to all his colleagues on his floor. 
  - Melanie Matthews was concentrating over her quarter-end reports when Joe appeared with the coffee made the way she liked it, "Touch of half-and-half, one sugar" despite not remembering having ever mentioned it to Joe.
  - It was also the very best coffee she had ever tasted.
- (Gus to Joe): "How did it feel, serving all those people?" 
  - "Tell you the truth? I felt like an idiot."

> "*Sometimes you feel foolish, even look foolish, but you do the thing anyway.*" 

### Chapter 7: Rachel `57`
- Joe guessed Pindar's age to be about the early sixties or about 58 - 59. Rachel revealed it to be 78.
  - "And even thuogh he's in his late seventies, he's one of the *youngest* people I know. Have you noticed how energetic and enthusiastic he is? How curious and... well, how *interested* he always seems?"
- "Of course he seems relaxed. He *is* relaxed. Whoever said being anxious gets more accomplished?"
- Rachel came from a poor neighbourhood and began working to help support her family when she was just 15. She took work doing anything and everything. Eventually, she put herself through college on this diverse collection of jobs.
  - Some of these tasks she enjoyed more than others. However, she approached each one as though she *loved it*. She did this by reminding herself that, regardless of how much or how little she cared for the task itself, she relished the opportunity to *survive, save and serve*.
    - *Survive*: to meet your basic needs
    - *Save*: to go beyond your basic needs and expand your life
    - *Serve*: to make a contribution to the world around you
- "Unfortunately, most people spend their entire lives focusing on the first. A smaller number focus on the second. But those rare few who are truly successful - not just financially, but *genuinely* successful in all aspects of their lives - keep their focus squarely on the third."

### Chapter 8: The Law of Influence `63`
- (Joe to Sam): "You must be the best insurance salesman in the world."
  - "I started out as the worst! When my goal was to sell insurance, I was no good at all."
  - "Changing my focus from seeing what I could *get* to what I could *give* was when my career started to take off. *Started* to. But in a business like mine - actually, in *any* business - you also need to know how to *develop a network*.
- A *network* doesn't necessarily mean your customers or clients. It means a network of people who *know you, like you and trust you*. They might never buy a thing from you, but they've always got you in the back of their minds.
  - "They're people who are personally invested in seeing you succeed y'see? And of course, that's because you're the same way about them. They're your army of *personal walking ambassadors*."
  - Having your own army of *personal walking ambassadors* will have referrals coming your way faster than you can handle them.
- "You want to know what makes that kind of network happen, Joe?"
  - "*Stop keeping score.*"
- (Sam to Joe): "You know how people say 'win-win'?"
  - "Always look for the solution where you both come out ahead."
  - "That's right, and it sounds great - in theory. But most of the time, what people call 'win-win' is really just a disguised way of keeping track. Making sure we all come out even, that nobody gets the advantage. Even-steven. I scratched your back, so now you owe me."
  - "When you base your relationships - in business or anywhere else in your life - on who owes who what, that's not being a *friend*. That's being a *creditor*."
- "*Watch out for the other guy*. Watch out for *his* interests. Watch *his* back. Forget about fifty-fifty, son. Fifty-fifty's a losing proposition. *The only winning proposition is one hundred percent*. Make your win about the other person, go after what *he* wants. Forget win-win - *focus on the other person's win*. 

> **The Law of Influence**: *Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first.*

- "If you place the other person's interests first, *your* interests will always be taken care of. *Always*. Some people call it *enlightened self-interest*. Watch out for what other people need, with the faith that when you do, you'll get what *you* need."
- Most people may say that money, position or even a history of outstanding accomplishments create influence. On the contrary, they have that backwards. Those things don't *create* influence - influence creates *them*.
- Joe described Sam and Nicole as *magnetic*. As well as Ernesto and even Pindar. He could not say what it was that made them *magnetic*, they just were. 
  - "Giving. That's what they have in common. Giving."
  - "Have you ever wondered what makes people attractive? I mean, genuinely attractive? Magnetic?"
  - "They love to give. That's why they're attractive. *Givers attract*."

### Chapter 9: Susan `73`
- Joe and Susan had established a sort of unwritten rule. They both had high-stress jobs and would arrive home for the evening in knots, each with at least a solid hour or two of extra office work to do. The unwritten rule was "We each get up to thirty minutes of complaint time, no more."
- That night, Joe stayed to listen on past the "thirty minutes of complaint time". It was an incredibly emotional night for Susan as she talked about so many different issues and covered so much ground. It seemed as if for Susan, *everything* was wrong. 
- The next morning, Joe found a note on Susan's pillow addressing him as *Sweetheart*. She had not called him that in a long time. In that note, she thanked him for his generosity and for listening to her.
  - "I can't remember ever feeling so... so *listened to*. So *heard*."
- Joe realised it wasn't about complaining at all, Susan just wanted him to *listen* and just wanted to be *heard*. 
  - "*Stop keeping score!*"

### Chapter 10: The Law of Authenticity `81`
- "These lessons don't apply only to business, Joe. A genuinely sound business principle will apply anywhere in life - in your friendships, in your marriage, *anywhere*. Not whether it simply improves your financial balance sheet, but whether it improves your *life's* balance sheet."
- "I believe there is one reason, and only one reason, that we have stayed together so long and are as happy together today as we were forty-eight years ago - more so, in fact. That reason is this: *I care more about my wife's happiness than I do about my own*. All I've ever wanted to do since the day I met her is make her happy. And here's the truly remarkable thing - she seems to want the same thing for me."
- "That year, the keynote speaker was a man I'd never heard of before. He talked about the importance of adding value to what you sell. 'Whatever it is you sell,' he told us, 'even if it's a mundane commodity that everyone else is selling too, whether it's real estate, insurance or hot dogs. Whatever it is, *you can excel by adding value.* If you need money, add value. And if you need a *lot* of money, add a *lot* of value.'"
- "I learned something that day. When I said that my life as a mom, wife and household manager left me with nothing the marketplace wanted, I was wrong. There *was* something else I'd learned over those years, and that was how to be a friend. How to care. How to make people feel good about themselves. And that, my friends, is something the marketplace wants very much - always has, always will."
- "The speaker at that symposium had said, '*add value*'. I had nothing to add but myself. And apparently, that was exactly what'd been missing."
- "People, remember this: no matter what your training, no matter what your skills, no matter what area you're in, *you* are your most important commodity. The most valuable gift you have to offer is *you*."
- "Reaching any goal you set takes ten percent specific knowledge or technical skills - ten percent, *max*. The other ninety-plus percent is *people* skills."
- "As long as you're trying to be someone else, or putting on some act or behaviour someone else taught you, you have no possibility of truly reaching people. *The most valuable thing you have to give people is yourself*. No matter what you *think* you're selling, what you're really offering is *you*."

> **The Law of Authenticity**: *The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.*

### Chapter 11: Gus `97`
- (Joe to Gus): "You just love what you do. You love talking with people, asking them questions, learning all about them, finding ways you can help them, serve them, fill a need, share a resource..."

### Chapter 12: The Law of Receptivity `101`
- (Pindar to Joe): "When you were young, what did you learn about giving?"
  - "It is better to give than to receive."
  - "Exactly! *It's better to give than to receive*, right? If you're a good person, that's what you do, you give. Good people give and don't think of receiving. But you, you think about receiving all the time, you can't help it. Which means you're probably not really a very good person... so why bother trying? All this giving stuff sounds great - for some people. For people like me, maybe, or Nicole, or Ernesto. But not for you It's just not who you are."
- "It's not *better* to give than to receive. It's *insane* to try to give and *not* receive."
  - "Trying not to receive is not only foolish, it's arrogant. When someone gives you a gift, what gives you the right to refuse it - to deny their right to give?"
  - "Receiving is the *natural result* of giving."
  - "In fact, *every* giving can happen *only* because it is *also* a receiving."
- "You can lead a horse to water... but you can't force him to *take* the water you offer."
- "All the giving in the world won't bring success, won't create the results you want, unless you also make yourself willing and able to receive in like measure. Because if you don't let yourself receive, you're refusing the gifts of others - and you shut down the flow."

> **The Law of Receptivity**: *The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.*

### Chapter 13: Full Circle `113`
- (Gus to Joe): "You can't measure your success by whether or not you get the account. That's not the point"
  - "The point is not *what you do*. Not *what you accomplish*. It's *who you are*."

### Chapter 14: The Go-Giver `121`
- In the final chapter, Claire meets Joe for the first time:
  - "Claire, welcome! Thanks for taking the time to see me," said the third founding partner of Rachel's Famous Coffee. 
  - "It's an honour, sir," Claire replied, as she wondered, "Why is *he* thanking *me*?"
- Similarly in Chapter 2, Joe meets Pindar for the first time:
  - "Joe! Welcome!"
  - "Good morning, sir," Said Joe. "Thank you for taking the time to see me."
  - "You're welcome - and thank *you*, for exactly the same reason." Pindar smiled broadly over his firm handshake. Joe returned a somewhat bewildered smile of his own and wondered, "Why is *he* thanking *me*?"

> *Go give - and remember to stay open to receiving*

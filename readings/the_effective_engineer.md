### Introduction `1`
- To be `effective engineers`, we need to be able to **identify which activities produce more impact with smaller time investments**. 
  - _Not all work is created equal. Not all efforts, however well-intentioned, translate into impact_.
- What makes an effective engineer? 
  - People who get things done and produce results?
  - But if they take too long to do it, are they still considered effective?
- Effective engineers also need to be efficient.
  - But efficiency alone does not guarantee effectiveness. 
- An effective engineer focuses on `value` and `impact`.
  - They know how to choose _which_ results to deliver.
  - Defined by the rate at which he or she produces value per time worked.

## Part 1: Adopt the Right Mindsets
> Mindsets that allow us to reason more rigorously about and increase our effectiveness 


### Chapter 1: Focus on High-Leverage Activities `9`
- Use `leverage` to measure your engineering effectiveness.
  - Leverage = `Impact Produced` / `Time Invested`.
  - Leverage is the Return on Investment (ROI) for the effort that's put in
- Systematically increase the leverage of our time.
  - By reducing the time it takes to complete a certain activity.
    - How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?.
  - By increasing the output of a particular activity.
    - How can I increase the value produced by this activity?
  - By shifting to higher-leverage activities.
    - Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce more value?
- Focus your effort on leverage points.
  - Time is our most limited asset. Identify the habits that produce disproportionately high impact for the time we invest.


### Chapter 2: Optimize for Learning `19`
- Own your story.
  - Focus on changes that are within your sphere on influence rather than wasting energy on blaming the parts you can't control.
  - View failures and challenges through a growth mindset, and see them as opportunities to learn.
- Don't shortchange your learning rate.
  - Learning compounds like interest. The more you learn, the easier it is to apply prior insights and lessons to learn new things.
  - Optimize for learning, particularly early in your career, and you'll be best prepared for the opportunities that come your way.
- Find work environments that can sustain your growth.
  - Interview the people at the team or company you're considering.
  - Find out what opportunities they provide for onboarding and mentoring, how transparent they are internally, how fast they move, what your prospective co-workers are like, and how much autonomy you'll have.
- Capitalize on opportunities at work to improve your technical skills.
  - Learn from your best co-workers. Study their code and their code reviews.
  - Dive into any available educational material provided by your company, and look into classes or books that your workplace might be willing to subsidize.
- Locate learning opportunities outside the workplace.
  - Challenge yourself to become better by just 1% a day. 
  - Not all of your learning will necessarily relate to engineering skills, but being a happier and better learner will help you become a more effective engineer in the long run.


### Chapter 3: Prioritize Regularly `41`
- Write down and review to-dos.
  - Spend your mental energy on prioritizing and processing your tasks rather than on trying to remember them.
  - Treat your brain as a processor, not as a memory bank.
- Work on what directly leads to value.
  - Don't try to do everything.
  - Regularly ask yourself if there's something higher-leverage that you could be doing.
- Work on the important and non-urgent.
  - Prioritize long-term investments that increase your effectiveness, even if they don't have a deadline.
- Reduce context switches.
  - Protect large blocks of time for your creative output.
  - Limit the number of ongoing projects so that you don't spend your cognitive energy actively juggling tasks.
- Make if-then plans to combat procrastination.
  - Binding an intention to do something to a trigger significantly increases the likelihood that you'll get it done.
- Make prioritization a habit.
  - Experiment to figure out a good workflow.
  - Prioritize regularly, and it'll get easier to focus on and complete your highest-leverage activities.

## Part 2: Execute, Execute, Execute 
> Key strategies to consistently execute and make progress with tasks we're faced with


### Chapter 4: Invest in Iteration Speed `63`
- The faster you can iterate, the more you can learn.
  - Conversely, when you move too slowly trying to avoid mistakes, you lose opportunities.
- Invest in tooling.
  - Faster compile times, faster deployment cycles, and faster turnaround times for development all provide time-saving benefits that compound the more you use them.
- Optimize your debugging workflow. 
  - Don't underestimate how much time gets spent validating that your code works.
  - Invest enough time to shorten these workflows.
- Master the fundamentals of your craft.
  - Get comfortable and efficient with the development environment you use on a daily basis.
  - This will pay off dividends throughout your career.
- Take a holistic view of your iteration loop.
  Don't ignore any organizational and team-related bottlenecks that may be within your circle of influence.


### Chapter 5: Measure What You Want to Improve `83`
- Measure your progress.
  - It's hard to improve what you don't measure.
  - How would you know what types of effort are well spent?
- Carefully choose your top-level metric.
  - Different metrics incentivize different behaviours.
  - Figure out which behaviours you want.
- Instrument your system.
  - The higher your system's complexity, the more you need instrumentation to ensure that you're not flying blind.
  - The easier it is to instrument more metrics, the more often you'll do it.
- Know your numbers.
  - Memorize or have easy access to numbers that can benchmark your progress or help with back-of-the-envelope calculations.
- Prioritize data integrity.
  - Having bad data is worse than having no data, because you'll make the wrong decisions thinking that you're right.


### Chapter 6: Validate Your Ideas Early and Often `107`
- Approach a problem iteratively to reduce wasted effort.
  - Each iteration provides opportunities to validate new ideas.
  - Iterate quickly to learn quickly.
- Reduce the risk of large implementations by using small validations.
  - Invest a little extra effort to figure out if the rest of your plan is worth doing.
- Use A/B testing to continuously validate your product hypotheses.
  - By incrementally developing a product and identifying what does and doesn't work, you increase the probability that your efforts are aligned with what users actually want.
- When working on a solo project, find ways of soliciting regular feedback.
  - It may be easy and comfortable to keep working in a silo, but you run the huge risk of overlooking something that, if spotted early, could save you lots of wasted effort.
- Adopt a willingness to validate your decisions.
  - Rather than making an important decision and moving on, set up feedback loops that enable you to collect data and assess your work's value and effectiveness.


### Chapter 7: Improve Your Project Estimation Skills `127`
- Incorporate estimates into the project plan.
  - These estimates should be used as an input to decide whether delivering a set of features by a certain date is feasible.
  - If it is not, they should lead to a conversation about whether to change the feature set or the delivery date.
  - Don't let a desired target dictate the estimates.
- Allow buffer room for the unknown in the schedule.
  - Take into account competing work obligations, holidays, illnesses, etc.
  - The longer a project, the higher the probability that some of these will occur.
- Define measurable milestones.
  - Clear milestones can alert you as to whether you're on track or falling behind. 
  - Use them as opportunities to revise your estimates.
- Do the riskiest tasks first.
  - Reduce variance in your estimates and risk in your project by exploring the unknown early on.
  - Don't give yourself the illusion of progress by focusing first on what's easy to do.
- Know the limits of overtime.
  - Many teams burn out because they start sprinting before they're even close to the finish line. 
  - Don't sprint just because you're behind and don't know what else to do.
  - Work overtime only if you're confident it will enable you to finish on time.

## Part 3: Build Long-Term Value
> Approaches for building long-term value


### Chapter 8: Balance Quality with Pragmatism `155`
- Establish a culture of reviewing code.
  - Code reviews facilitate positive modeling of good coding practices.
  - Find the right balance between code reviews and tooling to trade off code quality and development speed.
- Invest in good software abstractions to simplify difficult problems.
  - Good abstractions solve a hard problem once and for all, and significantly increase the productivity of those who use it. 
  - But if you try to build abstractions when you have incomplete information about use cases, you’ll end up with something clunky and unusable.
- Scale code quality with automated testing.
  - A suite of unit and integration tests can help alleviate the fear of modifying what might otherwise be brittle code. 
  - Focus on ones that save the most time first.
- Manage your technical debt.
  -  If you spend all your resources paying off interest on your debt, you won’t have enough time left to work on new things. 
  - Focus on the debt that incurs the most interest


### Chapter 9: Minimize Operational Burden `173`
- Do the simple thing first. 
  - Simpler systems are easier to understand, extend, and maintain.
- Fail fast to pinpoint the source of errors. 
  - Make debugging easier by not masking your errors and by not deferring failures until later.
- Automate mechanics over decision-making. 
  - Aggressively automate manual tasks to save yourself time. 
  - At the same time, think twice before trying to automate decision-making, which tends to be hard to get correct.
- Aim for idempotence and reentrancy. 
  - These properties make it easier for you to retry actions in the face of failure.
- Plan and practice failure modes. 
  - Building confidence in your ability to recover lets you proceed more boldly.


### Chapter 10: Invest in Your Team's Growth `193`
- Help the people around you be successful. 
  - The high rungs of an engineering ladder are reserved for those who make their co-workers more effective. 
  - Moreover, the success of those around you will also carry you along.
- Make hiring a priority. 
  - Keep a high hiring bar and play an active role in growing your team.
- Invest in onboarding and mentoring. 
  - The more quickly you can ramp up new team members, the more effective your team will be. 
  - The more effective your team, the more freedom you have to tackle different projects.
-  Build shared ownership of code. 
  - Increase your bus factor to be greater than one so that you’re not a bottleneck for development. 
  - This will give you the flexibility to focus on other highleverage activities.
- Debrief and document collective wisdom. 
  - Reflect on projects with team members, learn what worked and what didn’t work,
and document and share the lessons so that valuable wisdom doesn’t get lost.
-  Create a great engineering culture. 
  - This will help you be more productive, streamline decisions, and recruit other strong engineers. 
  - You build a great culture by fostering the same habits you need to effectively deliver impact.

### Epilogue `215`
#### `Time` is our most finite asset, and `leverage` — the value we produce per unit time — allows us to direct our time towards what matters most.

> We should always ask ourselves: Does the work I'm doing provide the highest leverage for my current goal? If not, why am I doing it?

`Leverage` is the lens through which effective engineers view their activities. You may also have realized that most of the advice in this book applies beyond engineering. The limitations of time apply just as much in life as it does in work. The principle of leverage can guide us towards those life activities that provide the highest impact for our efforts.

When we’re planning our finances, we should spend signifcantly more time on negotiating our salaries and setting up our investment asset allocations — both of which could lead to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars down the line — than on agonizing over the tens of dollars that we might save by changing a coﬀee habit. When planning trips or events, we should focus on the parts that matter most to us — whether it’s the location, the food, the activities, the invitees, or something else — before sweating the smaller details. We should make similar calculations about the best use of our time when we’re debating whether to hire a virtual assistant, outsource a task to a remote team, or call Uber or Lyf instead of waiting for public transportation. 

Does this perspective mean that we should be pursuing only high-leverage activities? No; that would be exhausting. We enjoy plenty of leisure activities like traveling, hiking, salsa dancing, and spending time with family and friends without giving any thought to whether they’re high-impact or represent the optimal use of our time—and that’s how it should be. But when it comes to achieving our work and life goals, leverage is a powerful framework for helping us focus on the right things.
